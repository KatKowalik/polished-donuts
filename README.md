## Description

Polished Donuts is a web application that brings the joy of Polish-style donuts to the digital world. While the project is still in its working phase, users can already explore information about the donut store and learn about the rich history of Polish-style donuts. The website also provides account functionality, allowing users to create an account and log in securely.

In the future, we plan to transform this platform into an online store where users can not only read about donuts but also subscribe to receive these delectable treats at their doorstep.
